<p>From the start of the project we've received a lot of very useful feedback. Say, Christopher Vogt and Stefan Zeiger wanted to experiment with LINQ-flavored facilities for Scala. They needed reification, composability of queries, static checking/optimization of queries and transparency for the user. After a couple of discussions, we'd come up with several ways of doing all that stuff with macros in a win-win fashion.</p>

<p>We're hinting that your feedback is priceless and has the possibility to significantly affect the design of Scala's macro system. Got a compelling use-case that can be simplified by macros? Just drop us a line! Macros are still experimental, so even at this point it may be possible to adapt macros to your personal use-cases. Looking forward to your comments!</p>
